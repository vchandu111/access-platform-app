Node,Node Intermediate,Mongo Advance  Queries,1 min,Implementation,Medium,How do you perform a wildcard search in MongoDB? HINT: Use $regex operator,"To perform a wildcard search in MongoDB, you can use regular expressions with the $regex operator. Here's an example query:

db.collection.find({ field: { $regex: /pattern/ } })

In this query, field is the name of the field you want to search, and pattern is the regular expression pattern you want to match. The $regex operator matches any string that contains the specified pattern.

For example, to find all documents in a collection where the name field contains the string ""John"", you can use the following query:

db.users.find({ name: { $regex: /John/ } })

This will return all documents where the name field contains the string ""John"", such as ""John Smith"", ""John Doe"", etc.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,

If you want to include only the name and age fields in the output, how can you do it? 
How would you add a new field called age_group based on the age field,
which checks whether the age field is less than 18, and returns the string ""minor"" if true, or ""adult"" if false.","The $project operator in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline is used to reshape documents, to include, exclude or rename fields, and to create new computed fields.

The basic syntax of $project is as follows:


{
  $project: {
    <field1>: <expression1>,
    <field2>: <expression2>,
    ...
  }
}
Here, <field1> and <field2> are the names of the fields that you want to include or exclude from the output, and <expression1> and <expression2> are the expressions that you use to transform or compute values for those fields.

For example, suppose you have a collection of documents with the following structure:


{
  ""_id"": ObjectId(""123456789012345678901234""),
  ""name"": ""Alice"",
  ""age"": 30,

If you want to include only the name and age fields in the output, you can use the following $project stage in your aggregation pipeline:


{
  $project: {
    _id: 0,
    name: 1,
    age: 1
  }
}
Here, _id: 0 means that the _id field should be excluded from the output, while name: 1 and age: 1 mean that the name and age fields should be included in the output.

You can also use expressions to transform or compute values for fields. For example, if you want to add a new field called age_group based on the age field, you can use the following $project stage:


{
  $project: {

  }
}
Here, $cond is a conditional expression that checks whether the age field is less than 18, and returns the string ""minor"" if true, or ""adult"" if false. The result of this expression is assigned to a new field called age_group.

Note that the $project stage can also be used to rename fields using the syntax <existing_field>: <new_field_name>. For example, you can rename the name field to full_name using the following $project stage:


{
  $project: {
    _id: 0,

How would you output one document for each interest of each person?","The $unwind operator in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline is used to deconstruct an array field in the input documents and output one document for each element of the array. The $unwind operator is often used in combination with other operators, such as $group and $project, to manipulate and analyze the elements of the array.

The basic syntax of the $unwind operator is as follows:

{
  $unwind: {
    path: <array field>,
    includeArrayIndex: <optional>,
    preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: <optional>

}
Here, <array field> is the name of the array field you want to unwind. The optional includeArrayIndex parameter lets you specify a new field to output that contains the index of each element in the array. The optional preserveNullAndEmptyArrays parameter lets you specify whether to include documents in the output for empty or null arrays.

For example, suppose you have a collection of documents with the following structure:


{
  ""_id"": ObjectId(""123456789012345678901234""),

Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,1 min,Knowledge,Low,What is Socket.IO?,"Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications that enables bidirectional, event-driven communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. It allows developers to create real-time web applications that can update the user interface in response to data changes without the need for the user to refresh the page.

Socket.IO works by establishing a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing data to be transmitted in real-time. It uses websockets, a protocol for real-time communication over the web, as well as fallback mechanisms such as polling and long-polling for browsers that do not support websockets.

With Socket.IO, developers can create applications that involve real-time chat, collaboration, online gaming, and more. It is open-source and can be used with Node.js, a popular server-side JavaScript runtime.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Rejected,1 min time is fine to define socket.io,Yes
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,What are the advantages of using Socket.IO?,"Real-time communication: Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional communication between a client and server, which allows for real-time updates and messaging in web applications.

Cross-browser support: Socket.IO provides fallback mechanisms such as polling and long-polling to support real-time communication in browsers that do not support websockets.

Scalability: Socket.IO is designed to be scalable and can be used in a distributed architecture to handle a large number of concurrent connections.

Ease of use: Socket.IO is easy to use and provides a simple API for developers to work with. It also includes built-in features for error handling, connection management, and more.

Customization: Socket.IO can be customized to suit the needs of different applications. Developers can create custom events and data structures to meet their specific requirements.

Open source: Socket.IO is open source and has a large community of developers contributing to its development and maintenance.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Rejected,Difficutly of this question should be type of medium,Yes
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,What are the disadvantages of using Socket.IO?,"Increased complexity: Socket.IO adds complexity to the codebase, especially for applications that don't require real-time communication. Developers may need to spend more time learning the Socket.IO API and troubleshooting issues.

Performance: Socket.IO may have lower performance compared to lower-level socket libraries due to its additional overhead, especially if the application doesn't require fallback mechanisms.

Security: Because Socket.IO allows real-time communication between a client and server, it can also introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Developers need to be aware of potential security issues and take appropriate measures to prevent attacks.

Debugging: Debugging Socket.IO applications can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex real-time interactions between multiple clients and servers.

Compatibility: Socket.IO is built on top of websockets, which may not be supported by all browsers.

Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,1 min,Knowledge,Low,What is a socket in Socket.IO?,"In Socket.IO, a socket refers to an individual connection between a client and a server. A socket is a unique identifier for a connection, and it represents a bidirectional communication channel between the client and server.

When a client connects to a Socket.IO server, a new socket is created to represent that connection. The server maintains a list of all connected sockets, and it can send and receive messages to and from each socket.

Sockets in Socket.IO are event-driven, which means that they can send and receive messages in response to specific events. The client and server can emit events to each other, and they can also listen for events from each other.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Rejected,1 min time,Yes
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,What is a namespace in Socket.IO?,"In Socket.IO, a namespace is a mechanism for grouping sockets together based on a common identifier. It allows developers to create separate communication channels within the same server instance, each with its own events and listeners.

When a client connects to a Socket.IO server, it can join a specific namespace by specifying the namespace in the connection URL. For example, a client can connect to the namespace ""/chat"" by connecting to the URL ""http://localhost:3000/chat"".

Once a client has joined a namespace, it can emit and receive events specific to that namespace. The server can also emit events to all sockets within a namespace or to a specific socket within that namespace.

Namespaces are useful for applications that require multiple communication channels within the same server instance. For example, a chat application might use one namespace for private messages and another namespace for group chat messages. By separating these channels into different namespaces, the application can better organize its code and reduce the risk of message collisions.

Socket.IO also provides a default namespace, which all sockets automatically join when they connect to the server. This namespace is identified by the string ""/"", and it is used for general communication between the client and server.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,What is a room in Socket.IO?,"In Socket.IO, a room is a mechanism for grouping sockets together based on a common identifier. Rooms allow developers to broadcast messages to specific subsets of connected sockets.

When a socket connects to a Socket.IO server, it can join a specific room by calling the ""join"" method on the socket object. For example, a socket can join the room ""chatroom1"" by calling the method ""socket.join('chatroom1')"".

Once a socket has joined a room, it can receive messages broadcasted to that room using the ""emit"" method on the server object. For example, the server can broadcast a message to all sockets in the room ""chatroom1"" by calling the method ""io.to('chatroom1').emit('message', 'Hello chatroom1!')"".

Rooms are useful for applications that require group messaging or real-time collaboration between subsets of connected sockets. For example, in a real-time multiplayer game, players might be grouped together based on their location or level, and the server can broadcast game state updates to each group separately.

Socket.IO also provides a default room, which all sockets automatically join when they connect to the server. This room is identified by the string ""socket.id"", where ""socket.id"" is the unique identifier assigned to each socket when it connects to the server.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Rejected,3 Min time is needed,Yes
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,3 min,Implementation,Medium,How can you join a room in Socket.IO? Use code to demonstrate.,"To join a room in Socket.IO, a socket can call the join() method on the socket object. The join() method takes a string argument, which is the name of the room to join.

Here's an example of how to join a room in Socket.IO:


// Client-side code
const socket = io();

// Join a room called ""chatroom1""
socket.emit('joinRoom', 'chatroom1');

});

In the example above, when the client connects to the server, it emits a ""joinRoom"" event with the room name ""chatroom1"". On the server, the socket joins the ""chatroom1"" room by calling the join() method on the socket object. The server logs a message indicating that the socket has joined the room.

Once a socket has joined a room, it can receive messages broadcasted to that room using the emit() method on the server object.

In the example above, when the client sends a ""sendMessage"" event with the message and room name, the server broadcasts the message to all sockets in that room by calling the to() method on the server object with the room name specified by the client. The server uses the emit() method to send the ""message"" event to all sockets in the specified room, along with the message data.

Note that if the server needs to send a message to all sockets, it can use the broadcast object on the socket object, like so: socket.broadcast.emit('message', 'Hello, everyone!');.

Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,5 min,Application,Medium,How can you broadcast a message to all clients connected to the server in Socket.IO? Use code to demonstrate.,"To broadcast a message to all clients connected to the server in Socket.IO, you can use the broadcast flag on the server-side emit() method. This will send the message to all connected clients except for the client that initiated the event.

Here's an example of how to broadcast a message to all clients connected to the server in Socket.IO:


// Server-side code
const io = require('socket.io')(http.createServer());

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // Handle a ""chat message"" event from the client
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    // Broadcast the message to all other connected clients
    socket.broadcast.emit('chat message', msg);
  });
});

http.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Socket.IO server started');
});
In the example above, when a client sends a ""chat message"" event to the server, the server broadcasts the message to all other connected clients using the broadcast flag on the emit() method. This will send the message to all other clients except for the client that initiated the event.

Note that to send the message to all clients, including the client that initiated the event, you can simply use the regular emit() method without the broadcast flag.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,5 min,Application,High,How can you send a message to a specific client in Socket.IO? Use code to demonstrate.,"To send a message to a specific client in Socket.IO, you need to have a reference to the socket object representing that client. You can store a reference to the socket object for each client when they connect to the server.

Here's an example of how to send a message to a specific client in Socket.IO:


// Server-side code
const io = require('socket.io')(http.createServer());
const clients = {}; // object to store references to client socket objects

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // Store a reference to the socket object for this client
  clients[socket.id] = socket;

  // Handle a ""private message"" event from the client
  socket.on('private message', ({ to, message }) => {
    // Send the message to the specified client
    clients[to].emit('private message', { from: socket.id, message });
  });
});

http.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Socket.IO server started');
});
In the example above, when a client connects to the server, the server stores a reference to the socket object for that client in an object called clients, using the socket.id as the key. When a client sends a ""private message"" event to the server, the server retrieves the socket object for the target client from the clients object using the to property of the message, and sends the message to that client using the emit() method.

Note that in this example, there is no error handling for cases where the specified client does not exist or is not currently connected to the server. You should add appropriate error handling to your code to handle such cases.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,10 min,Application,High,How can you use Socket.IO with Express.js to serve web pages? Use code to demonstrate.,"You can use Socket.IO with Express.js to serve web pages by using the express middleware provided by Socket.IO. The socket.io module exports a function that takes an http server instance as an argument and returns a Socket.IO server instance. You can then use the Socket.IO server instance to handle incoming connections and events.

Here's an example of how to use Socket.IO with Express.js to serve web pages:


const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const http = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(http);

// Serve static files from the ""public"" directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Route for the home page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

// Handle incoming connections with Socket.IO
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('a user connected');

  // Handle a ""chat message"" event from the client
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    console.log('message: ' + msg);

    // Broadcast the message to all other connected clients
    io.emit('chat message', msg);
  });

  // Handle the disconnect event
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('user disconnected');
  });
});

// Start the server
http.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
In the example above, we define an Express.js app and a http server instance. We then create a Socket.IO server instance using the http server instance, and use it to handle incoming connections and events. We also define a route for the home page and serve static files from the public directory using the express.static() middleware.

When a client connects to the server, the connection event is triggered and the server logs a message to the console. When a client sends a ""chat message"" event to the server, the server broadcasts the message to all other connected clients using the emit() method on the Socket.IO server instance. When a client disconnects from the server, the disconnect event is triggered and the server logs a message to the console.

Note that in this example, we are using the http server instance to create both the Express.js app and the Socket.IO server instance. If you already have an existing Express.js app, you can create a separate http server instance and pass it to both the Express.js app and the Socket.IO server instance.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,10 min,Application,High,How can you use Socket.IO with React.js to create real-time applications?,"To use Socket.IO with React.js, you'll need to install the socket.io-client package, which is the Socket.IO client for the browser. Here's an example of how to use Socket.IO with React.js to create a real-time chat application:

Install socket.io-client using npm:


npm install socket.io-client
Import the socket.io-client library in your React.js component:


import io from 'socket.io-client';
In the componentDidMount() method of your component, create a new Socket.IO client instance and connect to the Socket.IO server:



componentDidMount() {
  this.socket = io('http://localhost:3000');
}
In this example, we're connecting to a Socket.IO server running on localhost on port 3000.

Define an event handler to handle incoming messages from the server:

javascript
Copy code
handleIncomingMessage = (message) => {
  this.setState({ messages: [...this.state.messages, message] });
};
In this example, we're updating the component's state with the new message.

Emit an event to the server when the user submits a new message:


handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const message = this.state.newMessage;
  this.socket.emit('chat message', message);
  this.setState({ newMessage: '' });
};
In this example, we're emitting a chat message event to the server with the user's message. We're also clearing the input field after the message has been sent.

Handle incoming messages from the server by listening for the chat message event:


componentDidMount() {
  this.socket = io('http://localhost:3000');
  this.socket.on('chat message', this.handleIncomingMessage);
}
In this example, we're using the on() method to listen for the chat message event and pass the incoming message to the handleIncomingMessage() method we defined earlier.

That's it! With these steps, you can create a real-time chat application using Socket.IO and React.js. Of course, you'll need to add more functionality to your application to make it fully functional, but this should give you a good starting point.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Rejected,,

Set up a Socket.IO server using Node.js and the socket.io package:


const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer();
const io = require('socket.io')(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('a user connected');
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    console.log('message: ' + msg);
    io.emit('chat message', msg);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('user disconnected');
  });
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
In this example, we're creating a new HTTP server and initializing a new instance of Socket.IO. We're listening for the connection event, which is emitted by the server when a new client connects. When a client connects, we log a message to the console and listen for incoming chat message events. When we receive a chat message event, we log the message to the console and emit the same message to all connected clients using the io.emit() method. We're also listening for the disconnect event, which is emitted by the server when a client disconnects.


In this example, we're including the Socket.IO client library using the /socket.io/socket.io.js URL. We're also including a chat.js script, which is where we'll write our client-side code.

Write the client-side code in chat.js:


const socket = io();
const form = document.getElementById('message-form');
const input = document.getElementById('message-input');
const messages = document.getElementById('messages');

form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const message = input.value;
  socket.emit('chat message', message);
  input.value = '';
});

socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
  const li = document.createElement('li');
  li.textContent = msg;
  messages.appendChild(li);
});
In this example, we're initializing a new instance of the Socket.IO client and setting up event listeners for the message form and the chat message event. When the user submits a new message, we emit a chat message event to the server with the message contents. We also clear the input field after the message has been sent. When we receive a chat message event from the server, we create a new list item element and add the message contents to it, then append the list item to the messages element on the page.

That's it! With these steps, you can create a basic chat application using Socket.IO. Of course, you'll need to add more features and functionality to make it a fully-featured chat application, but this should give you a good starting point.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,

Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,3 min,Implementation,Medium,How can you limit the number of clients that can connect to a Socket.IO server?,"To limit the number of clients that can connect to a Socket.IO server, you can use the server.engine.clientsCount property to keep track of the number of clients currently connected, and then reject connections when the maximum number of clients has been reached. Here's an example of how you can limit the number of clients that can connect to a Socket.IO server:


const io = require('socket.io')(server);
const MAX_CLIENTS = 10;
let connectedClients = 0;

io.on('connection', (socket) => {

});
In the above code snippet, we're using a connectedClients variable to keep track of the number of clients currently connected. When a new client connects, we check if the number of connected clients has reached the MAX_CLIENTS limit. If the limit has been reached, we disconnect the client immediately and log a message to the console. If the limit has not been reached, we increment the connectedClients variable and log a message to the console indicating that a new client has connected.

Node,Node Intermediate,socket.io,5 min,Implementation,Medium,How can you limit the number of messages that can be sent to a client from the server in Socket.IO? You can use express-rate-limit library.,"To limit the number of messages that can be sent to a client from the server in Socket.IO, you can use a rate-limiting technique. There are several libraries available for Node.js that provide rate-limiting functionality, such as express-rate-limit and limiter.

Here's an example of how you can use the express-rate-limit library to limit the number of messages that can be sent to a client from the server:


const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const app = express();
const server = require('http').Server(app);

  max: 10, // limit each IP to 10 requests per minute
});

// Apply the rate limiter to the endpoint that sends messages to clients
app.post('/send-message', limiter, (req, res) => {
  // Send the message to the client
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log(`New client connected: ${socket.id}`);

    console.log(`Client disconnected: ${socket.id}`);
  });
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
In the above code snippet, we're creating a rate limiter that allows a maximum of 10 messages per minute. We're then applying the rate limiter to the endpoint that sends messages to clients. This ensures that clients can only receive a maximum of 10 messages per minute from the server.

Note that this implementation is very simple and only limits the number of messages sent to clients by a single endpoint. If you have multiple endpoints that can send messages to clients, you'll need to apply the rate limiter to each endpoint individually. Additionally, this implementation limits the number of messages per minute for all clients, regardless of their individual connection status or behavior.

The user initiates an authentication request to the web service via the third-party application.

The third-party application redirects the user to the web service's authentication server, which prompts the user to enter their login credentials.

The user enters their login credentials on the authentication server, which authenticates the user and generates an access token.

The access token is returned to the third-party application's server.

The third-party application's server can now use the access token to make authorized requests on behalf of the user to the web service's API.

The web service's API validates the access token and processes the request. If the token is valid, the API returns the requested data to the third-party application's server.

The third-party application's server can now use the data to provide services to the user.

OAuth uses a token-based system to authorize access to resources. Access tokens are short-lived and can be refreshed or revoked at any time, which provides an extra layer of security.

OAuth is widely used by popular web services, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub, to allow third-party applications to access user data.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Huzaifa,Yes,,,,Rejected,Make time limit to 3 min ,Yes
Node,Node Intermediate,Oauth,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,What are the advantages of using OAuth for user authentication and authorization?,"There are several advantages to using OAuth for user authentication and authorization:

Increased Security: OAuth allows users to grant access to their data without having to provide their username and password to third-party applications, reducing the risk of password theft or misuse.

User Control: OAuth provides users with the ability to grant and revoke access to their data at any time. This gives users more control over their data and privacy.

Simplified User Experience: OAuth simplifies the user experience by allowing users to sign in to third-party applications with their existing social media or email accounts, eliminating the need to create a new account for each service.

Scalability: OAuth is designed to handle a large number of users and applications, making it a scalable solution for user authentication and authorization.

Standardization: OAuth is an open standard, which means it can be implemented across different platforms and applications, allowing for interoperability between different systems.

Reduced Development Time: OAuth provides developers with pre-built authentication and authorization functionality, reducing the time and effort required to implement these features in their applications.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Huzaifa,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,Oauth,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,How does OAuth differ from traditional authentication systems?,"OAuth differs from traditional authentication systems in several ways:

User Permission: With traditional authentication systems, the user provides their login credentials (username and password) directly to the third-party application. With OAuth, the user grants permission to the third-party application to access their data without sharing their login credentials.

Token-based: OAuth uses access tokens to authorize access to resources, whereas traditional authentication systems typically use session cookies or other forms of authentication tokens.

Revocable: OAuth access tokens are revocable, which means that the user can revoke access to their data at any time, even after granting permission to the third-party application. Traditional authentication systems typically do not offer this level of control to the user.

Third-party Authentication: With traditional authentication systems, the user typically authenticates directly with the application they are accessing. With OAuth, the user authenticates with the authorization server, which verifies the user's identity and issues an access token to the third-party application.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Huzaifa,Yes,,,,Rejected,Make time limit to 3 min ,Yes
Node,Node Intermediate,Oauth,1 min,Knowledge,Medium,What is the role of access tokens in OAuth?,"Access tokens play a crucial role in OAuth. They are used to authorize access to protected resources, such as a user's data or resources on a web server.

When a user grants permission to a third-party application to access their data, the authorization server issues an access token to the application. The access token is a unique identifier that represents the user's permission to access the requested resources.

The third-party application then sends the access token with each request to the resource server, which verifies the token to ensure that the application has the necessary permission to access the requested resource. If the access token is valid, the resource server grants access to the requested resource.

Access tokens are typically short-lived and can expire after a certain period of time. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to protected resources if an access token is stolen or compromised.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Huzaifa,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,Oauth,3 min,Knowledge,High,What are the benefits of using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) with OAuth?,"JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) can provide several benefits when used with OAuth:

Stateless: JWTs are stateless, which means that the server doesn't need to store session information or maintain a database to keep track of which users are authenticated. This can simplify the implementation of the OAuth system and reduce server load.

Secure: JWTs use digital signatures to ensure the integrity of the token and protect against tampering. This makes them more secure than traditional session-based authentication methods, which can be vulnerable to session hijacking and other attacks.

Portable: JWTs can be used across different systems and platforms, making them ideal for building distributed systems and microservices.

Scalable: JWTs can be used to distribute authorization information across multiple servers, allowing for horizontal scaling and improved performance.

Versatile: JWTs can include arbitrary metadata, such as user information or other claims, which can be used by downstream systems to make authorization decisions.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Huzaifa,Yes,,,,Rejected,Make time limit to 3 min ,Yes
Node,Node Intermediate,setTimeout,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,What is event loop?,"The event loop is a core concept in JavaScript that allows for the execution of asynchronous code. It is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main execution thread.

The event loop works by continuously checking the message queue for new events or tasks to execute. When an event or task is added to the queue, the event loop will process it in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. If an event or task is long-running or blocking, it can cause the event loop to become blocked and prevent other tasks from being processed until it is completed.

To prevent the event loop from becoming blocked, JavaScript uses asynchronous callbacks and promises. When an asynchronous operation is started, such as a network request or a setTimeout() function, it is added to the queue along with a callback function. The event loop will continue to process other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. Once the operation is finished, the callback function is added to the message queue, and the event loop will process it when it gets to the front of the queue.

Overall, the event loop is a critical component of JavaScript that allows for the efficient handling of asynchronous code and ensures that the application remains responsive and performant.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Huzaifa,Yes,,,,Approved,,

The setTimeout function is part of the JavaScript Web API, which provides an asynchronous way to execute code in the future. When you call setTimeout, the browser schedules the execution of the callback function after the specified delay. However, the actual time at which the function runs is not guaranteed to be exactly the same as the time specified in the setTimeout call.

In general, the setTimeout function provides a reliable way to execute code after a specified delay, but it should not be relied upon for precise timing or real-time applications.

Node,Node Intermediate,process.nextTick(),1 min,Knowledge,Low,What is process.nextTick?,"process.nextTick() is a method in Node.js that allows a function to be executed on the next iteration of the event loop. When a function is passed to process.nextTick(), it is added to a queue of tasks to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, after the current operation has completed.

The main difference between process.nextTick() and setTimeout() is that process.nextTick() schedules a callback to be executed on the same phase of the event loop, after the current operation completes, while setTimeout() schedules a callback to be executed on a subsequent iteration of the event loop, with a minimum delay specified in milliseconds.

Using process.nextTick() can be useful for ensuring that a callback is executed before any other I/O events fire or other async operations occur. It can also be used to break up long running tasks so that the event loop is not blocked for too long. However, it's important to use process.nextTick() judiciously, as adding too many callbacks to the queue can cause the event loop to become blocked, leading to poor application performance.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Prakash,Yes,,,,Approved,,

Since the callback is executed immediately after the current operation completes, it's not subject to any minimum delay or latency.

setTimeout() is a method that allows you to schedule a callback function to be executed after a specified delay, measured in milliseconds. The callback function is placed on a timer queue, and will not be executed until the specified delay has elapsed.

This is because process.nextTick() allows you to defer the execution of a callback function until the next iteration of the Node.js event loop. If you schedule a process.nextTick() callback inside another process.nextTick() callback, and the inner callback schedules another inner callback, and so on, you can create an infinite loop that will keep executing callbacks without ever giving other parts of your application a chance to run.

Here's an example of how this could happen:

In this example, the doSomething() function logs a message to the console, and then schedules the ""doSomethingElse()"" function to be executed using ""process.nextTick()"". The ""doSomethingElse()"" function will be executed on the next iteration of the event loop, after the current operation (logging 'Doing something...') completes.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Prakash,Yes,,,,Approved,,

Node,Node Intermediate,process.nextTick(),3 min,Application,Low,"How would you use process.nextTick() to defer a callback until the next tick, while still allowing other I/O events to fire in the meantime?","To defer a callback until the next tick, while still allowing other I/O events to fire in the meantime, you can use process.nextTick() to schedule the callback to be executed on the next tick of the event loop. Here's an example:

function doSomething(callback) {

  process.nextTick(callback);
}

// example usage
doSomething(() => {
  console.log('Callback executed');

console.log('I/O event firing...');

In this example, the doSomething() function takes a callback function as an argument. The function performs some work and then schedules the callback to be executed on the next tick of the event loop using process.nextTick().

After calling doSomething(), the code logs a message to the console indicating that an I/O event is firing. However, because the callback has been scheduled to be executed on the next tick of the event loop, it will not be executed until all other I/O events that are currently queued have been processed.

When the callback is finally executed on the next tick of the event loop, it logs a message to the console indicating that it has been executed.

Overall, this approach allows other I/O events to fire in the meantime, while still ensuring that the callback is executed on the next tick of the event loop.

Here are some specific situations where process.nextTick() may be preferred:

Deferred execution of callbacks: If you have a callback function that you want to execute after the current operation completes, but before any other I/O events are processed, process.nextTick() is a good choice.

Avoiding blocking the event loop: If you have a long-running task that you need to break up into smaller, asynchronous steps, process.nextTick() can be used to schedule each step to run on the next tick of the event loop. This can help prevent your code from blocking the event loop and causing your application to become unresponsive.

Micro-optimizations: If you need to perform a large number of small, quick operations in succession, using process.nextTick() can be faster than setting up a series of timers with setTimeout(). This is because setting up a timer incurs a small amount of overhead, whereas process.nextTick() does not.

Overall, process.nextTick() is a good choice when you need fine-grained control over when a callback function is executed, and want to avoid the overhead of a timer.

Node,Node Intermediate,setImmediate,1 min,Knowledge,Low,What is the purpose of the setImmediate() function in Node.js?,"The setImmediate() function in Node.js is used to schedule a function to be executed immediately after the current operation in the event loop is completed. It provides a way to execute a callback function asynchronously, without blocking the event loop.

The setImmediate() function is similar to setTimeout() with a timeout value of 0, but it is more efficient and has a higher priority in the event loop.

The event loop operates in a continuous loop, processing events and callbacks in a predefined sequence of phases.

The phases of the event loop in Node.js are:

timers: This phase executes any callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() or setInterval() functions. Any callbacks in this phase are executed in ascending order of their timeout value.

I/O: This phase handles I/O operations, such as reading or writing to a file or network socket. Any callbacks for I/O events, such as receiving data from a network socket or completing a file read, are executed in this phase.

idle, prepare: These phases are internal and are generally not used in typical applications.

check: This phase executes callbacks registered by setImmediate(). Unlike setTimeout(), which executes its callbacks after a specified delay, setImmediate() schedules its callbacks to execute immediately after the current phase completes.

close callbacks: This phase executes any callbacks registered by the socket.on('close', ...) method. These callbacks are executed when a socket is closed.

After the close callbacks phase completes, the event loop checks for any outstanding setImmediate() callbacks before returning to the timers phase to begin the next iteration of the loop.

Overall, the event loop in Node.js allows for efficient and non-blocking handling of asynchronous operations, enabling Node.js to handle high levels of concurrent requests while remaining responsive and performant.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Prakash,Yes,"tag should be mid , implemention and answer should have block of code to demostrat",,,Rejected,"Answer should be framed well including all phase like ""Poll"" Phase also in solution, Time duration should be 3 min ",

setImmediate() returns an immediate object that represents the scheduled callback function. You can pass this object to clearImmediate() to cancel the callback before it's executed.

It is used to schedule a function to be executed immediately after the current operation in the event loop is completed, and is optimized for use in server-side applications.

In a browser environment, you can achieve similar functionality using the setTimeout() function with a delay of 0. This schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible, without blocking the UI thread. However, it's important to note that setTimeout() with a delay of 0 is not guaranteed to execute immediately, as the browser may have other tasks to complete before running the callback function.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Prakash,Yes,"question should be like ""is it possible to use....?"" format for better user experience",,Yes,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,process.nextTick(),1 min,Knowledge,Low,What is a tick?,"In the context of JavaScript and the event loop, a ""tick"" refers to a single iteration of the event loop.

The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a non-blocking way. When an asynchronous operation is started, such as a setTimeout() or fetch() call, it is added to a queue of pending operations. The event loop continuously checks this queue for pending operations and processes them one at a time, which is known as a tick.

During each tick of the event loop, the following happens:

The event loop checks the callback queue for any pending callbacks.
If there are any pending callbacks, the event loop runs the oldest one (i.e., the one that has been waiting the longest) and removes it from the queue.
If there are no pending callbacks, the event loop waits for new ones to be added.
This process continues indefinitely, with the event loop checking the queue for new pending callbacks and processing them in order, one at a time.

Each tick of the event loop can be thought of as a single iteration of the event loop, during which the event loop processes all pending callbacks that have been added since the previous tick. The exact definition of a tick can vary depending on the JavaScript environment and the specific implementation of the event loop.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Prakash,Yes,explanationn should be more descriptive ,,Yes,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,process.nextTick(),1 min,Knowledge,Low,"How is setImmediate() different from setTimeout(() => {}, 0) (passing a 0ms timeout), and from process.nextTick() and Promise.then()?","All four of these functions (setImmediate(), setTimeout(() => {}, 0), process.nextTick(), and Promise.then()) are used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, but they have some important differences in how they work.

setImmediate() and setTimeout(() => {}, 0) both schedule a function to run in the next iteration of the event loop, but they do it in slightly different ways. setImmediate() is designed to run a callback as soon as possible after the current iteration of the event loop, while setTimeout(() => {}, 0) schedules the callback to run after a minimum delay of 0 milliseconds. This means that setImmediate() will always run before any setTimeout(() => {}, 0) callbacks, even if they were scheduled before it.

process.nextTick() is similar to setImmediate(), but it schedules the callback to run at the end of the current iteration of the event loop, before any I/O operations are handled. This means that any I/O events that are scheduled during the current iteration of the event loop will be processed before the process.nextTick() callback.

Promise.then() schedules a callback to run after a Promise is resolved or rejected. Unlike the other functions, it does not schedule the callback in the next iteration of the event loop, but rather as soon as the Promise is resolved or rejected.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Prakash,Yes,check  the answer and and try  to  add more descriptive ,,Yes,Approved,,

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

myEmitter.once('hello', (name) => {
