Node,Node Intermediate,Caching,1 min,Knowledge,Low,What is caching in the context of web development?,"Caching in web development refers to the process of storing frequently used data or responses in a cache to improve application performance and reduce the load on the server. Caching can be implemented at various levels, such as the database level, application level, and client level, to reduce the number of requests made to the server and improve response time. When data is requested again, it can be retrieved from the cache rather than being regenerated, which can significantly improve the performance of the application.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,

It helps in reducing the load on the server and improving the performance of the web application.

On the other hand, client-side caching involves storing data on the client's machine, typically in the web browser's cache. This data can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and other resources. When a user revisits a page, the browser can load these cached resources from the local cache, rather than making a new request to the server.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mahesh,Yes,,,,Approved,,

1.Determine what to cache: It's important to identify the data that needs to be cached. Caching everything may not be feasible or efficient. Identify the parts of your application that can benefit most from caching.

2.Set an expiration time: Cache entries should have an expiration time. This ensures that stale data is not used, and the cache doesn't grow indefinitely. The expiration time should be set based on the data's frequency of change and importance.

3.Use a consistent key naming convention: The key used to store cache data should be consistent and easy to understand. This helps in debugging and maintaining the application.

4.Implement cache invalidation: When data changes, the corresponding cache entry should be invalidated. This ensures that the cache is always up-to-date.

These libraries provide a simple API for logging messages and can be configured to output logs to various destinations, including the console, files, and third-party logging services.

2.Use structured logging: Structured logging formats like JSON or key-value pairs are preferred over plain text messages because they make it easier to search and analyze log data. Structured logging also allows for better integration with logging services like Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

3.Use log levels: Log levels allow developers to filter log messages based on their severity. Common log levels include error, warn, info, debug, and trace. Use appropriate log levels to help identify issues and debug problems.

4.Log relevant information: Include relevant information in the log messages, such as the request path, HTTP status code, user ID, and error stack trace. This information can help in debugging and troubleshooting issues.

5.Avoid logging sensitive information: Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personally identifiable information (PII). If sensitive data needs to be logged, use encryption or obfuscation to protect it.

6.Use log rotation: Log files can grow rapidly and take up a lot of disk space. Use log rotation to limit the size of log files and archive old logs.

7.Monitor log data: Use log analysis tools to monitor and analyze log data in real-time. This can help detect and diagnose issues before they become critical problems.

// Log a message to both transports
logger.info('This message will be logged to both the file and the database.');


In this example, we first import the necessary modules from the winston library, including the ""createLogger"", ""transports"", and ""format"" modules.

We then define two transports: one for logging to a file ("" File""  transport) and one for logging to a database (""DailyRotateFile""  transport). We specify the desired log levels, file names, rotation settings, and formatting options for each transport.

Finally, we create a logger instance with both transports by passing an array of transports to the transports option. We can then log a message to both transports using the logger's ""info"" method.

By adding multiple transports to your logger instance, you can log to multiple destinations simultaneously, such as a file, a database, a console, or a remote logging service.

Node,Node Intermediate,Monitoring and Logging.,5 min,Implementation,Medium,"What is the purpose of adding metadata to a Winston log message, and how can you do this in your application?","Adding metadata to a Winston log message can be useful for providing additional context or details about the event being logged. Metadata can include any key-value pairs that provide more information about the log message, such as the user who initiated the event, the version of the application, or the request ID.

Here's an example of how to add metadata to a Winston log message in your application:

javascript
Copy code
const winston = require('winston');

// Create a logger instance
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.metadata({ fillExcept: ['message', 'level', 'timestamp'] }),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' })
  ]
});

// Log an event with metadata
const metadata = { requestId: '123456', userId: 'user123' };
logger.info('User successfully logged in', metadata);
In this example, we first create a logger instance with a json format and two transports (console and file).

To add metadata to our log messages, we use the metadata formatter from the winston.format module. This formatter adds any extra data passed as an object to the info method as metadata to the log message.

We then log an event with some metadata, including the request ID and user ID. This metadata will be included in the log message as a separate object.

By adding metadata to your log messages, you can make it easier to filter and search through logs for specific events or user activities, and provide more context for debugging or troubleshooting issues.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Tanya,Yes,,,,Approved,,

Node,Node Intermediate,CI/CD,3 min,Knowledge,Low,What is the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?,"Here's a comparative answer to highlight the key differences between Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD):

Continuous Integration vs. Continuous Deployment:

1.Purpose:

-CI: The purpose of Continuous Integration is to regularly build, test, and integrate code changes into a shared repository to detect defects and integration issues early in the development cycle.
-CD: The purpose of Continuous Deployment is to automatically deploy code changes to production environments once they have passed all tests and met any necessary criteria to speed up the release of software changes and ensure that the software is always in a releasable state.


Workflow:

-CI: In a CI workflow, code changes are automatically built and tested as soon as they are pushed to the shared repository. This helps ensure that code changes are compatible with the existing codebase and meet the quality standards of the development team.
-CD: In a CD workflow, code changes that pass through the CI process are automatically deployed to a staging or production environment, often without the need for manual approval. This helps speed up the release of software changes and ensure that the software is always in a releasable state.


Focus:

-CI: The focus of CI is on building and testing code changes to detect defects and integration issues early in the development cycle.
-CD: The focus of CD is on deploying code changes to production as quickly and efficiently as possible, while maintaining high quality and reliability.

Automation:

-CI: CI workflows typically involve a high level of automation, including automated builds, tests, and feedback, to ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested and validated before they are released.
-CD: CD workflows involve even more automation than CI, including automated deployments to production environments, to speed up the release of software changes and reduce the risk of human error.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Tanya,Yes,,,,Approved,,

Node,Node Intermediate,Github Actions,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,"How do you store sensitive data, such as API keys or access tokens, securely in GitHub Actions?","Storing sensitive data, such as API keys or access tokens, securely in GitHub Actions is important to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the data. Here are some best practices for storing sensitive data in GitHub Actions:

1.Use GitHub's built-in Secrets feature to store sensitive data. Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be used in your GitHub Actions workflows. To use a secret in your workflow, you'll need to reference it using the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax.

2.Use a third-party key management service, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to store sensitive data. You can then use a GitHub Action to retrieve the secrets from the key management service and use them in your workflow.

3.Avoid hard-coding sensitive data in your workflow YAML files or in your action code. Instead, use environment variables or secrets to reference the data.

4.Be careful when sharing or collaborating on GitHub Actions workflows that use sensitive data. Make sure to review the workflow code and remove any sensitive data before sharing it with others.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Tanya,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,Github Actions,5 min,Implementation,Low,"How do you create a custom GitHub Action?
Write the steps required.","To create a custom GitHub Action, you'll need to follow these steps:

1/Create a new repository on GitHub that will contain your custom action code.

2.Create a new directory within your repository that will contain the action code.

 3.This directory should have a name that reflects the purpose of the action.

4.Create a new YAML file within the directory that will define the inputs and outputs of the action, as well as the steps that the action will perform.

5.Write the code for the action steps. Depending on the complexity of the action, you may need to use a specific programming language or framework.
Commit and push your changes to the repository.

Once you've created your custom action, you can use it in your workflows by referencing its repository and directory name in your workflow YAML file. You can also share your custom action with others by publishing it to the GitHub Marketplace, which allows other users to easily discover and use your action in their own workflows.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Tanya,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,Github Actions,3 min,Knowledge,Medium,How do you use secrets in GitHub Actions?,"GitHub Actions allows you to use secrets to securely store sensitive information, such as access tokens, passwords, and API keys. These secrets are encrypted and only made available to your workflows, making them a safe way to store sensitive data.

To use secrets in GitHub Actions, you need to first define them in the repository settings. You can do this by going to the repository settings, selecting ""Secrets"", and then adding a new secret. You can name the secret and provide the value, which will be encrypted and stored securely.

Once you have defined the secrets, you can use them in your workflows by referencing them with the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax. For example, if you have a secret named ""API_TOKEN"", you can reference it in your workflow file like this:

steps:
  - name: Call API
    run: curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}"" https://api.example.com/


When you run the workflow, the value of the ""API_TOKEN"" secret will be substituted into the command, allowing the API call to be made securely.

It's important to note that secrets are only available to the workflow jobs that are run on the repository where the secrets are defined. If you want to use the same secrets in multiple repositories, you will need to define them in each repository separately.

In addition, you should always take care to ensure that secrets are not accidentally exposed in your workflow files or logs. You can use environment variables or other methods to avoid exposing secrets in plain text.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Tanya,Yes,,,,Approved,,
Node,Node Intermediate,Github Actions,5 min,Implementation,Medium,"How can you trigger a GitHub Action when a pull request is created or updated?
Also show an example workflow file that uses the pull_request event","You can trigger a GitHub Action when a pull request is created or updated by using the pull_request event in your workflow. The pull_request event is triggered whenever a pull request is opened, updated, or synchronized.

To use the pull_request event, you need to create a workflow file in your repository's .github/workflows directory, and specify the pull_request event as the trigger for the workflow. Here is an example workflow file that uses the pull_request event:

name: My Pull Request Workflow
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          # Build and test your code here
In this example, the workflow is triggered whenever a pull request is opened or edited. The workflow runs a job called ""build"", which checks out the code, builds and tests it.

You can customize the workflow to perform any actions that you need when a pull request is created or updated. For example, you can use the pull_request event to automatically run tests, deploy changes to a staging environment, or assign reviewers to the pull request.

By using the pull_request event in your workflows, you can automate your development processes and ensure that changes are tested and reviewed before they are merged into the main branch.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Tanya,Yes,,,,Approved,,
